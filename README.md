# Elysium-Resort
Elysium Resort is a fictional resort nestled in the picturesque Maldives, that offers a haven of tranquillity where every moment is crafted to inspire relaxation. I made this personal portfolio project to test my skills in JavaScript and Web design. Feel free to explore and I hope you like it.

## Stand Out Features
+ This website has a basic modal system. Rather than every room having a dedicated page, I used a modal system to save space and loading times to display the nearby locations and activities as well as the individual room options available at the resort.
+ Accordion, with a little help from stack overflow I was able to code a well-functioning accordion that automatically closes when you open another question in the accordion.
+ With this project, I was able to explore on-scroll JavaScript animations to create smooth sliding-in effects thus making the page a lot more dynamic and entertaining to navigate.
+ Navbar that appears when scrolling up. I am quite proud of how smoothly this feature works. The navbar only appears when a user scrolls up where they can link on the navigation bar to navigate and when scrolling down, it disappears once more.
+ Form Validation, in this project I made a form validation system to make sure that users are inputting the correct information and filling out the information before submitting the form successfully.

## Things to be aware of
1. This is just a demo website. The resort is not a real place and the website is just a show of my current skills.
2. The "See all Villas" and "Book a Villa Now" buttons are identical and lead to the same section on the website.
3. The Language selector and social links are just text, not actual links, therefore they will not lead anywhere when clicked.
4. The "Book Now" and "Get Directions" buttons do not work.
5. The video on the website is VERY low quality to save space and loading time.
